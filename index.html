<p>hey baby ma</p>
<p>i know its been a while since i called you baby. kissing you is not what is love, talking you on dates is not love, send flirty texts or romantic messages isnt love, giving gifts is not love, clicking good picture isnt what love is, love is respest, standing up to you,supporting you, isnt fighting with you buy fighting for you. it is standing next to you when you are at your worst. is about holding on to tears, trusting, its this unbreakablr emotional bond. and i would like to have this with you. </p>
